React is a Javascript library not a framework, that is used to easily build and arrange user interfaces for web applications.

React focuses on creating web application using these things called components.

A component is a self contained section of code, that functions as a resusable building block. 

React uses syntax extension of JavaScript that is known as JSX, meaning JavaScript and XML. Meaning it will allow you to write HTML like of code in JavaScript files. 

React also utilizes a virtual DOM, a lite weight version of Real DOM of a web page. 

We can keep track of any changes, made to the virtual DOM and only apply that specific changes to the Real DOM without needing to refresh the entire web page, only that specific section, this reduces rendering performance, overhead. 

For React you need to know everything about JavaScript such as array, object, classes, arrow functions, high order function and for-Each loop.

React runs on Node.

Currently React projects are developed in a bundler or building tool called Vite.
    Command:- npm create vite@latest 

    then,
    Enter the vite project name:- project_name 

    Select the framework:- React

    Select the variant:- JavaScript 

-> a folder or directory will be created 
    then,
        cd  project_name

        npm install or npm i 

        npm run dev (in development mode)

     then,
        Local: http://localhost:5173/
